Instructions on joining a project. 1.2 Directories and their structure Working with text based interfaces, where you are writing and running commands, means that we need to have some understanding of the underlying computer architecture. You need to have some appreciation for how files are organised within folders/directories and why its important to know which directory you are working from. Under Files in the bottom right panel of your screen you will see a file with the ending .Rproj. This is an R project file which tells R where you are working in the server. It means that R will automatically treat your project location as the working directory. If you wish to access files in any of the listed folders/directories you will need to tell R the path that it needs to follow in order to access these files. We have just covered some key words so lets have a look at what some of them mean now. 1.2.1 Moving around folders/directories Look in the ‘files’ tab in the panel to the bottom right. You should have three folders stored there, called; data plots scripts You can move around folders/directories in the command line, and its good be be comfortable doing this. Make sure you are in the Terminal tab in the panel to the bottom left and type; ls Hit Enter The ls command is shorthand for list. The terminal should return something that looks like this; /cloud/project$ ls data plots project.Rproj scripts So you can see your three directories. You can move between directories within the Terminal by using the cd command (cd is shorthand for change directory). Lets go and have a look at the files held within data. Use for following command; cd data/ now use; ls The terminal should return something that looks like this; /cloud/project/data$ ls databases refseq unknown_cory.fasta So you can see that you can use commands like ls and cd to move around your directories. Note - if you want to move back up a directory level you can use the cd .. to do so. Use cd, ls and cd .. to explore the directories available to you in your project. 1.2.2 Paths So hopefully you are getting comfortable moving between directories in the terminal. Here I will briefly introduce you to paths. Type in the following so that everyone is in the same location; cd /cloud/project If you want to enter some commands from this location that use the mouse.1.protein.faa file stored in the refseq directory you will need to provide a path for the location that file. These paths can either be absolute or relative. Relative paths provide a pathway from your current directory (in this case /cloud/project) so here this might be; data/refseq/mouse.1.protein.faa However if you are already in the databases directory, this path wont work because your computer will be looking for directories it cant see. This is where absolute paths come in useful. Absolute paths specify the location of a file or directory in relation to your root directory / (the top most directory in a hierarchy). So it doesn’t matter which directory you are currently in, the pathway will work. In this case the absolute path would be; /cloud/project/data/refseq/mouse.1.protein.faa Have a go at using both absolute and relative paths with the cd command to move around your directories. 1.3 File types When we look at sequence data there are a number of file types that you will regularly come into contact with. The most common of these however are .fastq and .fasta files. Here we will have a look at some key features and differences of these file types. Fastq files are a used as a data storage file for the output from next generation sequencers, such as those used for Illumina sequencing. The structure of a .fastq file is very uniform, each sequence has four lines dedicated to it. Line 1 - begins with an ‘@’ character and is followed by an identifier and optional description. For example it may contain informaiton about the sequencer, the flow cell, index number etc. Line 2 - is the raw sequence Line 3 - a ‘+’ character and sometimes a repeat of line 1 Line 4 - computer readable information relating to the quality for the sequence in line 2. This must have the same number of characters as the sequence An example of three sequences from an Illumina sequencer in .fastq format is shown below; @NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:26113:7113 1:N:0:ATCACGAT GCATGTCTCTAGTTCCGGAACCAAAATCTCCTCCACCCACTCTGCGTCCTGCTGACTATAGGAGATAAAGGCGTCATAGCAGAGGGTGGCGCCTCCTTGGTGCACCGCCGGCTTTCGCTTCGCCTTAAACCAGGCGACGGACATTTTCAGG + AAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEEEEEEEEEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAEEEEEEEEEAAEE&lt;AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEEEEEEE&lt;EA @NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:24170:10019 1:N:0:ATCACGAT GCATGTCAACATCATTCTTGTTTTGTTAGAGCCACTACCTACATATCTTATCCCTTCCAAGTACTACCAGCTAAAGGCAATGATACATGC + AAAAAEA/EEEE/EEEEEEEEEEEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEAEAEEEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEEE/EEEEEEAE/E/AEEAE @NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:7027:14110 1:N:0:ATCACGAT GCATGTGATGTTGTGTTTTTGTACTCTCCTCTCACTTTGTCCAAAGTGAGTGGTGTCATTATGAGTTGTATTTTGCTAACCACCAGAGACTAACACGAGGGCTGGACAACATCATTCTAGTTTTGTTAGAGCCACTACCTACATATC + AAA/AEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAEAAEEEEAAEEEEEEE/EEEAEEEEA/EE6EEEEEEEEEEEE6EE/EAEEE/EEEAAEAEEE/EEEEEE6EEEAE/&lt;EAEEEEEE/EEAEEAE&lt;E//AE&lt;&lt;/EAEA//&lt;&lt;&lt;A6AE/EEEE/A/EA Fasta files are a text based file format for representing either nucleotide or amino acid sequences. These can be produced from .fastq files. Each sequence in .fasta format comes with a header line which is marked by a ‘&gt;’ character prefix. Information following the ‘&gt;’ should contain a sequence identifier and optional description of the sequence. An example of three sequences from an Illumina sequencer in .fasta format is shown below, you may notice that these are the same sequences as shown previoursly in the .fastq example; &gt;NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:26113:7113 1:N:0:ATCACGAT CTCTAGTTCCGGAACCAAAATCTCCTCCACCCACTCTGCGTCCTGCTGACTATAGGAGATAAAGGCGTCATAGCAGAGGGTGGCGCCTCCTTGGTGCACCGCCGGCTTTCGCTTCGCCTTAAACCAGGCGACGGACATTTTCAGG &gt;NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:24170:10019 1:N:0:ATCACGAT CAACATCATTCTTGTTTTGTTAGAGCCACTACCTACATATCTTATCCCTTCCAAGTACTACCAGCTAAAGGCAATGATACATGC &gt;NB501793:9:H77L2BGX2:1:11101:7027:14110 1:N:0:ATCACGAT GATGTTGTGTTTTTGTACTCTCCTCTCACTTTGTCCAAAGTGAGTGGTGTCATTATGAGTTGTATTTTGCTAACCACCAGAGACTAACACGAGGGCTGGACAACATCATTCTAGTTTTGTTAGAGCCACTACCTACATATC Now, lets have a look at your data. The /cloud/project/data/refseq directory contains files downloaded from the NCBI Reference Sequence project. These files comprise a set of transcript and protein sequences for the mouse and zebrafish model systems and were downloaded from the NCBI. Use your new found command line tools to move into the refseq directory. When you run ls you should see the following; /cloud/project/data/refseq$ ls mouse.1.protein.faa mouse.1.rna.fna zebrafish.1.protein.faa zebrafish.1.rna.fna Use the head command to have a look at the first few lines of each of the four files stored in refseq. An example of the head commands usage is as follows; head mouse.1.protein.faa What differences do you notice about the four files? Do you think these are examples of .fastq or .fasta files? You might have noticed that their are two file suffixes (or file extensions) across these four files .faa and .fna. These file extensions can tell you quite a lot about the content of the file. Can you work out what these file extensions might be telling you? 1.4 Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) The acronym BLAST stands for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, it is a very versatile and useful program, frequently used in bioinformatic analysis. In essence it compares nucleotide or protein sequences to a database and uses statistics to calculate the significance of the similarities between hits. It has a range of uses; including assisting in the identification of sequences and assessing evolutionary relationships between sequences. There are different types of BLAST that work with nucleotide or amino acid input sequences. You have probably uploaded sequences to the NCBI website and used their BLAST tool from a web browser before, this can compare your query sequence against the entirety of GenBank. Here we will be looking at how to run BLAST from the command line against a local database. 1.4.1 Making a BLAST database In order to run BLAST we will need to make some suitable BLAST databases. Initially we will be using sequences from our mouse refseq files as queries to blast against databases made from our zebrafish refseq files. So lets convert our refseq zebrafish files into blast databases. Run the following command in the terminal; makeblastdb -in /cloud/project/data/refseq/zebrafish.1.rna.fna -dbtype nucl -out /cloud/project/data/databases/zebrafish.1.rna Take a moment to break down this command. You are essentially calling a function makeblastdb, you have told it which files you want to input using -in pathway/file and told it where this file is located via the path. You have also given instructions on what type of database you wish to produce (i.e. a nucleotide database) using -dbtype nucl and given instructions on where you want this database to be stored using -out pathway/file_prefix. Use the cd and ls commands to go to /cloud/project/data/databases/. Have a look at the new files stored there. There should be three and they should have .nhr, .nin, .nsq file extensions. Now try and make a similar data base for the zebrafish.1.protein.faa refseq file. You will need to instruct makeblastdb to make a prot (protein) database instead of a nucl database. Check your results in /cloud/project/data/databases/. Once again there should be thre files and they should have .phr, .pin and .psq file extensions. 1.4.2 Finding a query So hopefully you have a protein and nucleotide database prepared. Now we need to find a suitable query. We could use an entire mouse refseq file. But that would take a long time. Lets take a single entry from the mouse protein refseq file instead. To do this in the command line we can use awk, this is a scripting language used for the manipulation of data. In bioinformatics it is frequently used for filtering sequence files. For now, I would like you to use the awk command below, this will copy lines 5 and 6 of the mouse.1.protein.faa file and paste them in a new file called mouse.1.protein.1.faa in the query directory. awk &#39;NR==5 , NR==6&#39; mouse.1.protein.faa &gt; /cloud/project/data/query/mouse.1.protein.1.faa Use head to look at the contents of the mouse.1.protein.1.faa file in the query directory. Hopefully it should look something like this; &gt;YP_220552.1 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mitochondrion) [Mus musculus domesticus] MFINRWLFSTNHKDIGTLYLLFGAWAGMVGTALSILIRAELGQPGALLGDDQIYNVIVTAHAFVMIFFMVMPMMIGGFGNWLVPLMIGAPDMAFPRMNNMSFWLLPPSFLLLLASSMVEAGAGTGWTVYPPLAGNLAHAGASVDLTIFSLHLAGVSSILGAINFITTIINMKPPAMTQYQTPLFVWSVLITAVLLLLSLPVLAAGITMLLTDRNLNTTFFDPAGGGDPILYQHLFWFFGHPEVYILILPGFGIISHVVTYYSGKKEPFGYMGMVWAMMSIGFLGFIVWAHHMFTVGLDVDTRAYFTSATMIIAIPTGVKVFSWLATLHGGNIKWSPAMLWALGFIFLFTVGGLTGIVLSNSSLDIVLHDTYYVVAHFHYVLSMGAVFAIMAGFVHWFPLFSGFTLDDTWAKAHFAIMFVGVNMTFFPQHFLGLSGMPRRYSDYPDAYTTWNTVSSMGSFISLTAVLIMIFMIWEAFASKREVMSVSYASTNLEWLHGCPPPYHTFEEPTYVKVK Note that the refseq .fasta file has been formatted so that each entry has two lines, one for header, one for sequence. This means that we are able to simply pull out sequence entries based on line number. Odd numbered lines will be headers and even numbered lines will be sequences. 1.4.3 BLASTp blastp -query /cloud/project/data/query/mouse.1.protein.1.faa -db /cloud/project/data/databases/zebrafish.1.protein -out /cloud/project/data/blast/mouse.1.protein.x.zebrafish.txt -outfmt 6 YP_220552.1 NP_059333.1 88.132 514 61 0 1 514 1 514 0.0 877 YP_220552.1 XP_021326074.1 31.818 66 32 2 427 482 16 78 6.7 29.3 YP_220552.1 NP_001373511.1 31.818 66 32 2 427 482 48 110 7.5 29.6 grep -nr &quot;NP_059333.1&quot; refseq/zebrafish.1.protein.faa &gt; NP_059333.1_zebrafish.txt 209:&gt;NP_059333.1 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mitochondrion) [Danio rerio] orrigional &gt;YP_220552.1 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mitochondrion) [Mus musculus domesticus] 1.4.4 BLASTn and BLASTx "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).

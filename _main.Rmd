# Bioinformatics skills 

Here we will start to build a bioinformatics skill set, using the command line.

## Getting started 

Some Blurb on setting up an R studio cloud account - maybe take some bits from phil or BIO-4001A. Instructions on joining a project. 

## Moving around directories

Look in the 'files' tab in the pannel to the bottom right. You should have three folders stored there, called;

* data
* plots
* scripts

You can move around directories in the command line, and its good be be comfortable doing this. Make sure you are in the 'Terminal' tab in the panel to the bottom left and type

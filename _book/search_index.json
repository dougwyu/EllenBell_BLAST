Instructions on joining a project. 1.2 Directories and their structure Working with text based interfaces, where you are writing and running commands, means that we need to have some understanding of the underlying computer architecture. You need to have some appreciation for how files are organised within folders/directories and why its important to know which directory you are working from. Under Files in the bottom right panel of your screen you will see a file with the ending .Rproj. This is an R project file which tells R where you are working in the server. It means that R will automatically treat your project location as the working directory. If you wish to access files in any of the listed folders/directories you will need to tell R the path that it needs to follow in order to access these files. We have just covered some key words so lets have a look at what some of them mean now. 1.2.1 Moving around folders/directories Look in the ‘files’ tab in the panel to the bottom right. You should have three folders stored there, called; data plots scripts You can move around folders/directories in the command line, and its good be be comfortable doing this. Make sure you are in the Terminal tab in the panel to the bottom left and type; ls Hit Enter The ls command is shorthand for list. The terminal should return something that looks like this; /cloud/project$ ls data plots project.Rproj scripts So you can see your three directories. You can move between directories within the Terminal by using the cd command (cd is shorthand for change directory). Lets go and have a look at the files held within data. Use for following command; cd data/ now use; ls The terminal should return something that looks like this; /cloud/project/data$ ls databases refseq unknown_cory.fasta So you can see that you can use commands like ls and cd to move around your directories. Note - if you want to move back up a directory level you can use the cd .. to do so. Use cd, ls and cd .. to explore the directories available to you in your project. 1.2.2 Paths So hopefully you are getting comfortable moving between directories in the terminal. Here I will briefly introduce you to paths. Type in the following so that everyone is in the same location; cd /cloud/project If you want to enter some commands from this location that use the mouse.1.protein.faa file stored in the refseq directory you will need to provide a path for the location that file. These paths can either be absolute or relative. Relative paths provide a pathway from your current directory (in this case /cloud/project) so here this might be; data/refseq/mouse.1.protein.faa However if you are already in the databases directory, this path wont work because your computer will be looking for directories it cant see. This is where absolute paths come in useful. Absolute paths specify the location of a file or directory in relation to your root directory / (the top most directory in a hierarchy). So it doesn’t matter which directory you are currently in, the pathway will work. In this case the absolute path would be; /cloud/project/data/refseq/mouse.1.protein.faa Have a go at using both absolute and relative paths with the cd command to move around your directories. 1.3 File types Use your new found command line tools to move into the refseq directory. When you run ls you should see the following; /cloud/project/data/refseq$ ls mouse.1.protein.faa mouse.1.rna.fna zebrafish.1.protein.faa zebrafish.1.rna.fna Use the head command to have a look at the first few lines of each of the four files stored in refseq. An example of the head commands useage is as follows; head mouse.1.protein.faa What differences do you notice about the four files?
